  <strong>Abstract.</strong>
  Modern astronomical surveys generate massive volumes of stellar spectra,
  making manual inspection of unusual objects impractical.
  We present an unsupervised, real-time anomaly detection pipeline for stellar
  spectra that learns normal spectral behavior directly from data and
  automatically flags unusual candidates without requiring labels.
  The system is evaluated on real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra and
  demonstrates stable anomaly detection across repeated observation cycles,
  identifying both physically distinct spectra and data-quality anomalies.
</p>


  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Large spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
    collect millions of stellar spectra.
    Identifying rare or unusual objects within these datasets is a key scientific
    challenge.
    Traditional approaches rely on predefined classes or manual inspection,
    which do not scale effectively.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Dataset</h2>
  <p>
    We use real optical stellar spectra from SDSS, covering wavelengths from
    approximately 3800 Å to 9200 Å.
    The data are unlabeled, motivating the use of unsupervised learning methods.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    Each spectrum is resampled onto a common wavelength grid and normalized.
    A deep autoencoder is trained to learn compact latent representations of
    stellar spectra.
    Anomalies are detected using a combination of isolation-based methods applied
    to the latent space and reconstruction error from the autoencoder.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Real-Time Pipeline</h2>
  <p>
    The trained model is deployed in a streaming-like setting where spectra are
    processed sequentially.
    Anomalies are flagged immediately and logged, simulating the behavior of
    real astronomical survey pipelines.
  </p>

 <h2>5. Results</h2>

<p>
The anomaly detection pipeline identifies spectra that deviate significantly
from the learned distribution of normal stellar spectra.
Figure 1 compares a stable anomalous spectrum with a representative normal
spectrum, while Figure 2 shows their separation in the learned latent space.

    Comparison between an anomalous stellar spectrum (red) and a normal
    stellar spectrum (blue). The anomalous spectrum shows distinct emission
    features and flux behavior not well represented by the learned model.

    <strong>Figure 2.</strong>
    Latent space representation of stellar spectra after dimensionality
    reduction. The anomalous spectrum (red) is clearly separated from the
    cluster of normal spectra (blue), explaining its consistent detection
    across multiple observation cycles.

  <h2>6. Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    Visual inspection shows that one candidate exhibits a structurally distinct
    but coherent spectrum, while the other is dominated by noise and calibration
    artifacts.
    These results demonstrate the ability of the pipeline to detect both
    astrophysically interesting objects and data-quality anomalies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Limitations and Future Work</h2>
  <p>
    The current study is limited by dataset size and lack of physical confirmation.
    Future work will scale the pipeline to larger surveys, incorporate Gaia XP
    spectra, and integrate catalog cross-matching for validation.
